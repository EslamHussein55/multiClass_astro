# multiClass_astro
A multi-classification problem performed on astronomy data, where the goal is to classify astronomical objects named (Quasars, stars, Galaxies)) using machine learning. The data used contains almost 288 features, and the rebo has 3 tutorials that can help participants to do the following:
1. pre-process the data..
2. analyze the data...
3. feature engineer the data...
